    <h1>Miso Soup</h1>
    <img src="Miso-Soup-8271-II.jpg" alt="Miso Soup">
    <p>Miso soup is a staple in Japanese cuisine and is soup for the soul. We enjoy it almost every single day for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. As a Japanese home cook, I would also say that miso soup is probably one of the easiest soups you can make at home. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Kombu (dried kelp)</li>
        <li>Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)</li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Dashi</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Gently clean kombu</li>
            <li>Make slits in kombu to release flavour</li>
            <li>Cold brew kombu if you have time (2-3 hours), otherwise add dried kombu to medium saucepan</li>
            <li>Turn on heat to medium-low and bring to near boil, about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Clean from/debris from surface all along</li>
            <li>Just before boiling, remove kombu from pan (it can be saved for further recipes)</li>
            <li>Add kastuobushi to water and return to near boiling</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce heat and let simmer for 30 seconds, then remove from heat</li>

            <li>Strain katsuobushi (it can also be saved)</li>
            <li>Dashi is ready to use or be stored (it will keep for 3-5 days refrigerated)</li>
